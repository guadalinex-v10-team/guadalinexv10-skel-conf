# WARNING: It is inherently insecure to run a festival instance as a
# server, mainly because it exposes the whole system to exploits which
# can be easily used by attackers to gain access to your
# computer. This is because of the inherent design of the festival
# server. Please use it only in a situation where you are sure that
# you will not be subjected to such an attack, or have adequate
# security precautions.

# Set RUN_FESTIVAL=yes to run festival
